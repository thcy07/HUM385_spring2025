        <h1>Research </h1>
        
        <p>I will writing down impressions and feelings I have as I discover
            Heritage Sites and Museums that use Augmented Reality (AR) to enhance
            the visitor experience. I will also be writing down the design strengths
            and limitations of the current AR solutions in Europe. These observations
            will be based on the the specifications I have listed above.</p>

            <h2><b>Research Topic</b></h2>
            "Enhancing Museum and Heritage Site Experiences Through Augmented Reality: A Comparative Study of AR Use and
            Potential
            in Major European Cultural Institutions"
            
             <br><br>
            
            <h2><b>Research Questions</b></h2>
            "How can augmented reality (AR) technologies improve visitor experience, accessibility, and educational
            engagement in
            major European museums and historical sites?"
            
            "What are the design strengths and limitations of current AR solutions in European museums and historical sites,
            and how
            can computer engineering innovations improve user interaction, multilingual accessibility, and contextual
            learning?"

            <br><br>
            
            <h2><b>Research Strategy</b></h2>
            I will be observing the design strengths and limitations of the current AR solutions in Europe.
            
            I will be making case studies to see what features have worked to give us a wholesome experience. This will
            include
            on-site observations and technology evaluations of applications that already exist for the museums we will
            visit. 
            These evaluations will be on three main specifications: 
            <ol>
                <li><strong>User Interface / User Experience:</strong> How intuitive and enjoyable the AR application is for visitors.</li>
                <li><strong>Engagement:</strong> The degree to which users interact with and find value in a product, often measured by time spent, frequency of use, and user feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>Inclusivity:</strong> Designing products and experiences that are accessible and usable by people of all backgrounds, abilities, and experiences, ensuring no one is excluded.</li>
            </ol>

            If a museum doesn‚Äôt have one, I will try to make suggestions on how they can start to make one. I will try to 
            list the kind of information they could use to make it a good experience for all.

        <h2>Reason for Research</h2>
        <p>
            I started my research by exploring various museums and heritage sites across Europe 
            and their online sites to see what they had to offer in the Augmented Reality (AR) 
            technologies. I focused on how these institutions use AR to enhance visitor
            experiences. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I started this research because I am not someone that particularly enjoys museums, 
            but I do enjoy technology. I wanted to see how museums could use technology to make
            the experience more engaging and accessible. That's when I came by AR, I was particularly
            interested in how AR could make the experience more interactive. 

            This includes my findings before, on and after the trip. It also includes my suggested plans
            of improvements and observations for the museums and heritage sites that I visited.
        </p>

        <p> This video was the first to catch my attention and show me how interesting AR and art could 
            be. 
        </p>

        <br>
       <p> This video has some really fun ways it tries to show the artworks. This seemed really fun
            I wanted to try this out and experience this new way to view art. A new perspective.</p>

        <p> My expectations are not very high, I don't expect to test anything. As most of things that could 
            work are either really expensive or not available in the places I will be visiting. My purpose is to
            gather information and make a plan on how we can make a good AR experience for museums. I will be trying
            to curate a list of features and paintings that I think would be good to have in an AR app for museums.

      <h2>What is the difference between augmented reality and virtual reality?</h2>
        <p>
        Virtual Reality offers total immersion in a different reality. However, Augmented Reality (AR) shows reality and an
        altered version. VR replaces what the user sees with an alternate reality, while AR adds to what the user can already
        see. This means it can be helpful for annotating scenes and providing extra information.
        <br>
        It also puts scenes into context and highlights contrasts with the current reality. VR requires specialist technology,
        such as headsets, controllers and sensors. AR experiences only need a smartphone or tablet and are downloadable as apps.
        </p>

        <h2>Case Studies: On the Trip</h2>
        <p><h3><strong>üîç Pompeii, Naples</strong></h3> As a part of my research Pompeii seemed like a really good
            place to have AR. I remember reading about an AR tour that let you see the ruins as they might have
            looked in ancient times. The videos and website I visited had old videos and very old updates.
            The cost of these tours were also very high. I was not able to find any recent updates
            or information about the AR tours.

            <br>
            <strong id="mini_title"> On-Site impressions:</strong> I came across a few paintings on the streets of Pompeii that had
            some really interesting details. It was a rendition of the Pompeii in its prime. The colors were vibrant, a stage, 
            and homes were not half broken. They seemed like they would be really good inspiration for making an AR
            app or experimental tour.

            I asked around in the front booth as to what kind of digital tours they offer. The staff seemed oblivious to anything
            that was not a physical tour. They did not have any information about AR tours or digital tours.

            <strong id="mini_title"> Result:</strong> Nothing I could really test but these pictures as you see it you can see that one side it how 
            the building looks now and the other side is how it looked in its prime. This is would be a great inspiration for
            making an AR app or experimental tour. The video I linked above is of a tour offered 5 years ago on the site of pompeii.
            I am unsure that this tour is still available. I was not able to find any recent updates or information about this AR tours. 
            There was one site that offered virtual tours but the price was out of my budget and therefore could not test it. 
            <br> 
            These above pictures serve the purpose of what I was expecting to see in an AR tour. These pictures are all 2-Dimensional,
            AR will allow us to see this but in 3 dimensions. The reason it is called Augmented Reality is because it interacts with what 
            is already there. It improves, enhances, and adds more information, in shorts augments the reality that is already there. 

            I would suggest they bring back the AR tour that they were providing 5 years ago. I would also suggest that they try to 
            make a digital tour that is more affordable. I would also suggest that they try to make an AR app that can be used on-site
            to enhance the experience of the visitors.

        <p><h3><strong>üé® Vatican Museums</strong></h3> Digital overlays reconstruct damaged frescoes and ceilings. They have many
            digital tours. The website has a paid virtual tour. Nothing to the likes of AR or anything that interacts to with 
            the paintings or frescoes. No specific AR tours were available. The website was not very informative about the

            <strong id="mini_title"> On-Site impressions:</strong> We didn't have enough time to spend much time in the Vatican Museums due to the other 
            places we had to visit. I think a great idea for an AR app would be to have a tour that shows the different frescoes and
            paintings in the Vatican Museums. It also interacts with the paintings to add dimension and expression, excluding more than what
            can be viewed to the naked eye in 2D.

            <strong id="mini_title"> Result:</strong> Unfortunately, I was not able to test anything. This leaves me with suggestions for an APP is it was created.
            I gravitate towards the idea of an AR app that could be used on-site to enhance the experience of the visitors. As it can be accessed 
            through a phone, it would be more accessible to the visitors. It would also be more affordable than a digital tour and it would be 
            on site. 

     
            <h4> App Suggestions for any museum</h4>
            <p> Since the most sites and museums didn't really have anything tangible to test I think it is best to put the basic app suggestions here.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Have user-friendly interaction with the paintings.</li>

                <li>Presenting various paintings in the Museum and their historical context.</li>
                <li>Highlighting the different frescoes and how it might have looked when it was made.</li>

                <li>Have a feature that allows us to see the paintings in 3D.</li>
                <li> Have features where it might look like it let us into the world of the painting.</li>
                <li> Show fun visuals and that can be enjoyed as we maneuver through the painting. </li>

            I included anything that was implementing AR. This project was to revive the extinct animals.
            It was a really interesting project that showed how AR can be used to bring back extinct animals. The project new and I
            didn't know about this before. I dismissed this initially as it was not something related to art or historical sites. But
            I think it is a great example of how AR can be used to bring back extinct animals and how it can be used to educate people about the
            importance of conservation.

            <strong id="mini_title"> On-Site impressions:</strong>
            I tried to ask staff on site what they said they thought the AR was like and how the visitors were interacting with it. 
            This was a brief summary they gave [I have taken the liberty to paraphrase]: Visitors donned HoloLens 2 AR headsets and bone conduction headphones to engage
            with holographic reenactments of pivotalmoments from Colvin's life. The minimalist set design, combined
            with archival footage, spatialized soundscapes featuring artists like Nina Simone and Ray Charles, and
            the narration by Tania de Montaigne herself, created a deeply immersive experience.
            <br><br>
            This was an immersive installation was based on Tania de Montaigne's biographical essay Noire. La vie m√©connue de Claudette Colvin, which 
            chronicles the story of Claudette Colvin, a 15-year-old African American girl who, in 1955, refused to give up her seat on a segregated bus in 
            Montgomery, Alabama‚Äînine months before Rosa Parks' similar act of defiance.

            <strong id="mini_title"> Result:</strong> This was a research flaw on my side. I had not put enough time into looking at this project. The website 
            seemed like it was still offering this AR exhibition. It was suspended after 2023. It was a limited time exhibition. I was not able to test anything.
            This was indeed a great waste of time, which time I could have been better spent on the other museums and tested some that actually still offered AR.
            This ended with me not testing anything. Apart from this mishap, we were able to check out "Paris Noir" a black artists exhibition that was on display 
            at the time. These paintings were very detailed and they allowed me to see some great potential for the use of an AR app. My suggestion for this museum 
            is the same as all the other museums.

        <p><h3><strong>üîç The Louvre, Paris</strong></h3> In collaboration with Snap Inc., the Louvre launched "Egypt Augmented", 
        an AR experience that brings ancient Egyptian artifacts to life. Visitors can use their smartphones or Snapchat to
        scan QR codes placed near specific exhibits, revealing digitally restored versions of the artifacts as they might 
        have originally appeared. This was a limited time exhibition. I was available for only one year and ended last year. 
        I am glad and interested in what these museums are doing with AR. I hope they continue to do so. 

        <br><br>
        <strong id="mini_title"> On-Site impressions:</strong> The Louver is a huge museum, it was wonderful to see the different pairings.
        There are many paintings that are in the Louvre that could be used for an AR app and make it more fun. I was too overwhelmed
        by the size of the museum to but AR can make it fun for people who don't really see art like others do.            

        <strong id="mini_title"> Results:</strong> I came across a few paintings in the Louver that would be great to explaore in AR/ 3D.
        It was the 'Consecration of the Emperor Napoleon I and Coronation of the Empress Josephine in the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris
        on December 2, 1804' by Jacques-Louis David and the 'Pandemonium (1841), by John Martin'

            Looking at these paintings, I can see how AR can be used to enhance the experience of the visitors. Imagining being able to view
            the painting in 3D and being able to see the details that are not visible in the 2D painting. Feel like you are there in the event.
            The Coronation, being able to see the detail on the dress, some expressions and some important details on the main characters of 
            the painting. The Pandemonium, being able to see the details of the demons and the hellish landscape. The dark red, and big building 
            in the painting and the details of Satan. That would be such a cool experience. I would love to see what this could look like these
            paintings in 2D were great, but if it was in 3D i would spend more time seeing it and exploring it.

        <p><h3><strong>üó∫Ô∏è Natural History Museum, London</strong></h3> The Natural History Museum (NHM) in London launched Visions of 
        Nature in October 2024, an immersive mixed-reality experience transporting visitors to the year 2125 to illustrate the
        impact of human actions on the planet. Developed in collaboration with Microsoft and Saola Studio, the exhibition utilizes
        Microsoft HoloLens 2 headsets to present interactive holographic animations of species such as cuttlefish, Darwin‚Äôs frog, 
        and coconut crab, alongside natural wonders like the Scottish Highlands and Africa‚Äôs Great Green Wall.

        <strong id="mini_title"> On-Site impressions:</strong> After I missed the Natural History Museum in Paris, I made sure to visit the one in London.
        I was able to see the Visions of Nature exhibition. It was a great experience. The holographic animations were really well done.
        We had to wear a headset to see the holographic animations. The animations were really well done and they were able to show the
        details of the species and the natural wonders. It was interactive, it had me moving, tracking my movement and had times when I 
        had to extend my hand an I was able to interact with the holographic animations. It was interesting to see how they use mixed reality 
        to create a more wholesome experience. The head set had audion and visual aids as we went through the 20min exhibition. 

        <br><br>

        <strong id="mini_title"> Result:</strong> They had lifelike holograms of creatures like Darwin‚Äôs frog, coconut crabs, cuttlefish, and the hybrid "narluga" (a narwhal-beluga
        mix), showcasing potential evolutionary paths. The frog would jump up on my had and I could see it up close. The narluga was such a cool 
        specie to see!! I would swim me and pass me off. 
        
        <br><br>
        <strong id="mini_title">Somethings to improve:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>They could have elements we can interact with.</li>
            <li>The headset was a bit heavy and uncomfortable to wear for long periods.</li>
            <li>The exhibition was a bit short, I would have liked to see more holographic animations.</li>
            <li>The holographs were pretty good; it allowed us to see the great details.</li>

        <p><h3><strong>üó∫Ô∏è The National Gallery, London</strong></h3> They had an online VR tour. I read that they had AR as well. 
            they released and app in 2023 that was used to create a trail for kids to follow and play a game as they watched
            the paintings. The Keeper of Paintings and the Palette of Perception: An augmented reality (AR) treasure hunt 
            designed for children aged 7‚Äì11. Players explore the Gallery to find magical gems scattered across paintings, guided by the character Claws
            Monet. This experience is intended for use within the National Gallery. It seems like really fun and interactive way for kids to learn about art.

            <strong id="mini_title"> On-Site impressions:</strong> Unfortunately, as I enquired about this to te staff it seemed like they 
            had no clue that something like this was there. I wasn't able to locate anyone that knew about this project. The website had 
            information as to how to get the game downloaded, etc. I didn't indulge as this was not the focus of my research. I remember reading 
            they did have many digitally supported exhibitions and tours with artworks that were very famous. 
            
            As I was talking to the employee, they mentioned that there might something we figure out on the website. I found this VR tour on this website and it
            had a select number of paintings you were able to go into the room and select a certain painting and it would have a quiz like exploration for you to experience.

            The quiz like exploration was fun and interactive. I was able to learn about the paintings and the artists in a fun way. The paintings were still in 2D so not
            a lot of interaction with the painting. The program would ask me about how I saw a certain painting and what I thought about it. I found that interesting,
            it would tell me what others thought. It taught me a new way to think about paintings and fun trivia.

        <h2>What can AR do to change the way people view art?</h2>
        <div class="quote">
            ‚ÄúWhen museums adopt AR, they <strong>extend their interpretive space beyond the physical limits of the gallery.</strong>‚Äù
            ‚Äî Ross Parry, "Recoding the Museum: Digital Heritage and the Technologies of Change," Routledge, 2007
        
        </div>
        <p>
            Augmented Reality (AR) is revolutionizing how we experience museums and art. By blending the physical and digital worlds,
            AR offers a new lens through which to view, understand, and interact with cultural artifacts. Here are some key benefits:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Translate and present content in multiple languages and formats. It is also as cheap 
            as getting a QR code or installing an app. VR can be expensive as it has heavy headsets and difficult to make it accessible
            to all.</li>
            <li><strong>Interactivity:</strong> Let users zoom, rotate, and learn through play. It interactive enough to keep children in 
            engaged. This also works better for people like me don't know much about art and don't feel much by just looking at art. It can 
            help us find a was to interact with the painting that feel so distant to us. </li>
            <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Studies show AR boosts memory and understanding. This kind of experience is one of a kind and therefore
            has a high probability to retain in peoples memory. It can also have interactive quizzes that will allows people to remember and learn
            more about the painting and its history.</li>
            <li><strong>Inclusivity:</strong> Helps people of all ages and backgrounds connect with exhibits. It can also allow people with disabilities
            also enjoy and interactive experience with these painting. It can allow people to see, listen and read about the paint in 3D.   </li>
            <li><strong>Restoration:</strong> I heard that there is a little contention as to wether old sculptures should be restored and
            if it is who should get the credit. AR can solve this issue where we can keep the original and us AR to restore the sculptures
            which will still allow artists who restore it to gain recognition and still keep the original.  </li>

            <br> 

            Technology can solve many issues and introduce new ways to see, explore and understand thing. I can be the tool that bridges that gap
            for people who feel like they don't understand art. It can give us a new perspective. 
        </ul>

        <!-- <hr> -->

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Augmented Reality is more than just a cool gadget‚Äîit's a tool for deeper education, inclusion, and
            innovation in museums. As more institutions adopt this technology, we move toward a future where cultural
            history is not only seen, but felt, explored, and remembered.

            <p>
                My journey through European museums and heritage sites has shown that Augmented Reality is more than just
                a technological novelty‚Äîit is a powerful tool for transforming how we experience culture, history, and art. 
                While many institutions are still in the early stages of adopting AR, the potential is clear: AR can make 
                exhibitions more interactive, accessible, and memorable for all visitors, regardless of background or ability.
            </p>

                The case studies and on-site impressions reveal both the promise and the current limitations of AR in museums. 
                Some institutions have pioneered immersive experiences that bring extinct animals or lost histories to life, 
                while others are just beginning to explore digital enhancements. Across all examples, AR stands out for its 
                ability to bridge the gap between passive observation and active engagement, offering new ways to learn, explore, 
                and connect with exhibits.

                Moving forward, museums can harness AR to create more inclusive and participatory experiences‚Äîmaking art and history 
                accessible to wider audiences, supporting multilingual content, and enabling deeper contextual learning. As technology 
                continues to evolve, so too will the possibilities for storytelling, restoration, and education within cultural spaces. 
                Ultimately, AR invites us not just to see, but to experience and remember the stories that shape our world.

        <h2>Research Log</h2>
        <p>Hours spent on Research: </p>
        <ul>

            <li>Pre - Trip: I spent about <strong>4-5hrs</strong> on researching what AR is and how it is being used to improve
            the experience people have with Art. This includes finding locations to explore on-site.</li>
            <li>On-Site: I spent <strong>10-12hrs</strong> going to location on the trip and discovering new location that might have AR.</li>
            <li>Post-Trip: I spent about <strong>23-25 hrs</strong> creating and curating the website.</li>
        </ul>
